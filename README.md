It's really hard to understand people's heart. One by one, they say that I didn't do what I didn't do. In the end, they all did it at the critical moment. It's hypocritical. No one will look forward to you, they all hope you can fail from the bottom of their heart, so that they can sneer at you. It's hard to survive in this situation, no real friend
